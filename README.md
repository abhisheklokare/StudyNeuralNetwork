# Study Neural Network

## Overview

This repository was created as a study resource while following the "Neural Network from Scratch in Python" tutorial series by Sentdex on YouTube. The tutorial series is an excellent resource for understanding the fundamentals of neural networks and their implementation in Python using NumPy.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to document the learning process and provide notes that can help others who are following the same tutorial. The notes include explanations of key concepts, example calculations, and Python code referenced from the tutorial series.

## AI and ML Context

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are rapidly advancing fields, with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI (GenAI) leading the way. Understanding the basics of artificial neural networks is crucial as they are the foundational building blocks for these advanced technologies. Mastering these fundamentals will enable the design of more efficient and sophisticated neural networks.

## Notes

Part 1 of the notes covers the first four episodes of the tutorial series. The notes include:
- Definitions and explanations of neurons, weights, and biases.
- Step-by-step examples of calculations involving single and multiple neurons.
- Python code for implementing neural networks using NumPy.
